# Learning Process

## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique
<br>

### Q .1. What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.

* Feynman technique is a learning process that is named after a renowned physicist and noble prize winner Richard Feynman. Along with his contribution to science, another notable fact about him was that he was a great explainer and teacher. The reason to name this method after him was that his learning method was very powerful as he worked constantly on complex equations until he made them easy to understand for him, and he could break very complex topics into simple ones to explain to others.

* Though this method was named and inspired by a scientist, it is not restricted to only mathematical and scientific areas but can also be used to learn and properly understand the concept of any other field such as history, coding, and other non-mathematical subjects. 
  
* This method is very useful to either grasp or learn an entirely different topic or understand it properly, and can be implemented to test our knowledge and understanding of a topic.

* Feynman technique is defined as a learning technique consisting of four steps, that will enable one to grasp a tough concept easily and test the understanding of it.
  
* What differentiates this method from the regular memorization technique of learning is that it is continuous and self-evaluating as well as a practical approach for learning, by explaining the learned information to ourselves or someone else after writing in a notebook and thus helping us to organize our learning process and identify the missing gap in understanding. 

    This entire journey consists of these steps,

 1. Take a notebook, and start writing the concept that you intend to learn on the top of the page.
   
 2. Now, start writing all about that topic you know in such a way that you are teaching that concept to yourself and someone else. While doing these steps, make sure to have a practical view of that concept, so that you can relate it to real-life examples where its applications can be seen.
   
 3. In these steps, once you have written your notes and your learning material is complete, refer to it whenever you find it difficult to understand a sub-topic and check that even the toughest concepts to grasp are easily understood as other sub-topics.
   
 4. Finally, after learning a topic, this step is what checks that we have understood in such a way, that we can even explain it to any normal or non-technical person who is not familiar with any topic we learned, very easily. In this way, we can streamline our thought for learning effectively and test our learning simultaneously.
   
After applying this process, we always revise our learning and know where we have a solid understanding of a point in a topic and where we need to improve. In the end, to make full utilization of this technique check if this technique's outcomes are similar to the results that were achieved by its inspiration Feynman. This technique is named after him because he was able to explain hard concepts easily to others, we also need to simplify our knowledge so that not only it is easy for our learning but even a kid can grasp the same concept through our explanation.

### Q .2. What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?
* In my learning process related to web development concepts, this technique will be a boost in understanding the code logic and complex methods and functions, whereas just going through tutorials and solving that specific problem won't be enough to master those concepts.   

* Besides solving the code problems, this learning technique will also help me to get answers to questions like why this code is better than others, why it works, and why it is the best option in comparison to others.
  
* Along with understanding complex concepts, this technique will help me to learn topics and recall them for a longer period, and learn much faster as well.
  
* Since using this learning method I will have the notes written in a way to explain myself or someone else easily, it will increase my learning rate and fill my learning gaps whenever I get stuck on some topic.

### Q .3. Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.

* Keeping aside the hyper-complex network system of neurons inside our brain, for our understanding of brain functioning we can say that our brain has two primary modes. One is focused modes which we use while performing tasks that need continuous attention or being focused like writing a test, doing calculations, or riding a vehicle. The second mode is what we usually use while we are in a leisure state or relaxed mode, and it is called diffuse mode. 
  
* So, going by definitions of two modes, we may think that we only use focus mode to carry out all problems solving in our day-to-day life but, in reality, the diffuse mode is a crucial part that generates new ideas and solutions while we are not focused on our task. In this mode, we get the opportunity to rethink if we are doing the right things and in the right way, and also replenish our thinking power.
  
* While doing an activity requiring us to find solutions, we switch between focused and relaxed modes. In this way, to think within the limited scope while in focus mode, we get to broaden our scope in the diffused more, to find a proper working solution or a new and better idea. Diffused mode aids us to do the task efficiently where creativity is important and focus modes work better for technical tasks, quick functioning, and paying consistent attention.
  
* In our learning or working period, we often face procrastination, which makes us delay the task due to a problem that occurred in the process or by the nature of the problem. This procrastination can be treated as a pain movement occurring inside our brain which can be handled in two ways :
  
  1. By relaxing and switching to diffused mode as mentioned previously, we can find a solution to the problem making us procrastinate and give time to our focus mode to regain its smooth functioning ability, and thus procrastination goes away. 
   
  2. Another method is usually that consequence of procrastination we face which is getting diverted and leaving the task, for temporary pleasure like using social media.
   
* To deal with procrastination, we can use the Pomodoro technique, in which we stay completely focused for around 25 min avoiding any distractions. At this time, our goal is not to finish the task, but to stay attended and work continuously. After this focusing period, we take a few minutes of relaxation, which allows our mind to be in diffused mode, and repeat this cycle until our task is completed. So, in this way, we can avoid procrastination.
  
* Next point is that many people consider themselves slower than others in finding quick solutions. Being a slow thinker is not bad, it can result in mastery of concepts because we think about the details of the problems and don't directly jump to conclusions. But, this also requires working harder to grasp the concept to learn.
  
* There is something called the Illusion of Competency, that makes us think we mastered the material but when we test our understanding, we find ourselves in a scary situation of getting failed. This makes us realize that we had not learned the material properly. As per researchers, the solution to this problem, is to do regular exercise as it refreshen our mind and allows us to switch to diffused mode. Another important method is to give tests very often to check our learning. And finally, practice in the form of homework, but not just complete it once rather practice it, again and again, to grasp concepts until you master it.

* Next learning solution is recalling. An example of not learning properly or learning illusion can be to just highlight the sentences in the book that gives us a false sense of learning while reading and rereading, but mostly nothing goes in the mind. For this problem, use the method of reading a section and then looking away and trying to recall it. Doing this will build neural patterns that enhance our learning.

* And the last thing is that we should not think that understanding a resource means having expertise in that subject. This is like learning Pythagoras theorem but not being able to use it to measure distances in real life. Combining this with illustrative learning, practical learning, and experience gained related to that subject makes us experts in that subject in the true sense. 

### Question 4. What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?
* After going through entire steps for learning how to learn, I can improve my ability by taking these steps,
  
  1. Before starting my day to solve problems and learn, do exercise regularly, as this feeling will motivate and replenish my mind to work to its best capacity.
   
  2. While learning anything important, I need to use the Pomodoro method to avoid getting affected by the pain of procrastination and use the capability of both focused and diffused modes, for better learning.

  3. Next thing I need to consider is not getting the learning illusion by getting away from learning resources and recalling the concepts to check if I have learned them or not.
  
  4. Another step I need to take is to not try learning the entire resource at once, but rather break it into segments and takes an appropriate break in between, so I can use my diffused mode's capability for enhancing the learning process.
  
  5. Finally, to test my learning quality, I need to give many mini-tests and normal tests to see if my approach to the learning process is correct or not and whether I am doing that method effectively.

### Q .5. Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.

* A study was conducted on expert-level performance at Florida State University by professor K. Anders Ericsson. He studied world-class or international competing chess grandmasters, athletes, musicians, and other highly established competitive people in their fields. He studied how long it took them to reach their level of performance, in which he found that the time they invested in the dedicated practice of the elements or skills in their field was proportional to their performance. And, this is how the most popular number of '10,000' hours came out from this study conducted. This number was regarding the time it takes to reach an ultra-competitive level. Later, a book known as "Outliers: The story of success" was published in 2007 by author Malcolm Gladwell, whose focus was on the 10,000-hour rule and how constant practicing and performing well, will allow us to reach the previously mentioned competitive levels.

* Since this book made a position in top best sellers books, the message of 10,000 hours got widespread. Originally, the message was it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become a highly distinguished performer, but later after the book was published, it got diverted to the message like, it takes 10,000 to be an expert at something, then this expert changed to good and then, finally to message that, it takes 10,000 to know a skill, which is a false statement.

* What research shows in reality, is that when some people were given a task to learn some activity or skill whether physical or mental, initially they performed poorly as they were new to those activities, but after a long time of practicing they started getting better and more efficient. Later, they started getting good at their task in little times with more practice. So, this showed that at an early period of practice, people were very efficient and after some point, it becomes harder to progress, since the next steps of excellence needed practice and time. 
  
* Similar output can be observed from a learning curve for a person, where a person performs badly during the initial period, but gains high results after a certain period till that person become good at it. Once someone becomes good at some skill, further advancement has slow progress and a long time, which is the reason, only a few people make their way to achieve extraordinary performance. 

* Now, since many people first aim to achieve the target of becoming good at a skill, Josh Kaufman says a period of 20 hours for this achievement from his research. He suggested giving dedicated practice for up to 20 hours, which is 45 minutes daily for one month. Also, this method of 20 hours of learning has following the steps,
  
  1. First step would be to deconstruct a skill, which means breaking a skill into its components to plan the learning order and schedule time properly for each part.
  2. In this step, a person has to self-evaluate and correct him/her in the learning process. Here, helps from multiple sources can be taken, but care should be taken that we don't procrastinate due to multiple sources since our goal is to learn and practice rather than learn the same thing from multiple sources.
  3. Third and most important thing is to remove barriers like social media and environmental distraction since it makes us procrastinate or even worse leave learning. 
  4. Finally, in this simple step we have to remember that we do not feel frustrated and leave learning. We should make a strong commitment to 20 hours of learning, to overcome the same frustration and low confidence barrier.

The last point to remember while practicing this or any other learning is that it is not only related to intellectual capabilities but also to emotional ability. We can understand this by a simple example that we don't find it difficult to perform a task or hobby, that we are genuinely interested in doing. 

### Q .6. What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
* Here are some steps I would take to start learning something new,
  
1. While approaching or learning new topics, my first step is to know completely know about the topic or skill briefly, how to plan to learn it, what resources to use and how many hours will need to give it, and what time slot I will do the learning task.
2. Before starting the learning process, I will make notes whether digital or in a notebook to store the important methods, tips, and information.
3. Then, during the learning process, from whatever source I am learning, I would note the concept in a notebook or a text file, and the stored information will be such that, anyone can understand it very easily. 
4. If during the learning duration, procrastination becomes an obstacle, I would use methods as suggested in a TED talk by Barbara Oakley, that is to relax, exercise before or after learning and use Pomodoro to give my diffused mode of the brain a chance to create new ideas and thoughts for my learning topic.
5. After learning one section or one topic I will close the resources that I am learning from, and recall the topic to check if I mentally grasp the information.
6. Another step is that I will make sure that I will do the task on a specified time and complete it in around the number of hours, I decided before starting the learning so that I can avoid procrastination, and maintain consistency.
7. Along with theoretical learning, I would practice every task and homework multiple times and test my learning frequently, so that I will not be in learning Illusions and track my results of the learning process.
8. At the end of learning the topic, I will try to explain all sub-topics to myself or someone else, to test how well I have done the learning process and how easily I can explain it to others.
