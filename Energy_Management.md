### Q .1 What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?
* I talk to my friends and family to get relaxed after a tiring day at work.
* A shower also helps me to release my stress.
* When being focused for too long on a certain task, I take a break and surf the video on the internet.
* At times, when I sit for too long working on my laptop, I do some warm-up exercises to get out of stress

### Q .2 When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?
* When I am not able to solve a certain problem or complete a task.
* Get stressed if there is less time left to reach somewhere for important work and other activities.
* When I am not able to focus on my learning.
* When I lag to complete or achieve a certain goal before the deadline.
* When things don't go as I expected.
   


### Q .3 How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?
* I feel happy and excited when the situations given below happens:-
1. When I complete my work as I expected. 
2. I finish all my duties on time.
3. When I am about to get a positive output for working hard for something.
4. During the occasion, an unexpected good thing happens.

In these similar situations, I slowly starts to feel relaxed and motivated. Sometimes, these occasions increase my will to perform much better if it is related to some good result of my work. 

### Q .4 Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in detail.

* The session in the video starts with the mention of the adverse effects of lack of sleep. The speaker mentions that it is necessary to get sleep not only after learning but also before starting to learn something. This is because we cannot absorb new information while studying we are suffering from a lack of sleep.

* Matt mentions an experiment conducted where some people were divided into two groups. The first group was a sleep group and the second group was a sleep deprivation group. The sleep group was given full 8 hours of sleep and the sleep deprivation group was kept awake under supervision in a laboratory without providing naps and any kind of caffeine for measuring every person equally. On the next day, both groups were tested under an MRI scanner to measure the condition of their brains and see their performance in learning activities. A difference in the ability to learn between both groups was 40%. 

* This difference of 40% deficiency in learning ability due to lack of sleep should be a major concern, especially for the students in the education sector. This difference can also be one of the causes of the difference between well-performing students and students who fail the exam. Later, Matt describes what happens inside the brain which causes the learning deficiency. 

* There is a part inside our brains at the right and left side called Hippocampus which is responsible for receiving and storing information and memories. When the brain states of the groups which were provided with full sleep were observed, the healthy learning signals could be seen that the sleep-deprived group was missing. Therefore, the second group was not able to learn and store new memories due to the malfunctioning of the hippocampus.  

* If we observe the pattern of electrochemical signals during sleeping, we can see the powerful and high brain wave called sleep spindles and the combination of these waves enable us to shift our memories from temporary and short stage to permanent section of our brain.

* It is well-known fact that with aging our learning ability begins to decline, but there is one more which takes place that our sleep quality also reduces. Sleep and aging are related to each other and the decreasing quality of our deep sleep contributes to our declining learning ability during aging it was also discovered that it can result in Alzheimer's disease. 

* We cannot do much related to the working of the brain and its process, however, we can maintain the good working of our brain signal by improving our sleep quality. At the center where Matt works, the same problem of deprived sleep is treated by inducing a very small amount of voltage directly into the brain that can't be felt by humans. This voltage stimulates the brain waves at a significant amount and improves learning ability specifically for young adults. 

* Apart from ill effects on the reproductive system, sleep deprivation also affects the respiratory system. There was a global experiment conducted on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries and two times a year called 'Daylight savings times'. As per the experiment, in the spring season losing one hour of sleep, shows a 24% increase in a heart attack on the same day. And during the autumn season, gaining one hour of sleep resulted in a reduction of 21% in heart attacks. This concept was also found to be relevant in cases of accidents and suicides. 

* Sleep is also related to the immune system, which has natural killer cells that eliminate the dangerous unwanted elements in our body. These are the exact crucial elements we need in a healthy amount in our body, but don't get enough due to lack of sleep. An experiment was done to measure these immune cells when we only sleep for 4 hours just for one night and it was found that the reduction of these cells' activity was up to a massive rate of 70%. This study shows why sleep deprivation increases the chances of various cancers.  

* Even World Health Organization classified any kind of night shift work as the cause of major diseases due to sleep disruption of sleep. 
Many studies state that shorter sleep results in a shorter life. Sleep deprivation can also adversely affects DNA genes. Matt tells about one more experiment, where a group of healthy adults was only limited to taking six hours of sleep per night for one week. After measuring the change in gene activity profiles and comparing them to the period when the same people used to get 8 hours of sleep, the study shows that 711 genes were modified in their activity due to lack of sleep. Another change that occurred was that half of the genes were increased and the other half genes were decreased. Genes that were reduced represented the immune-related genes and other genes that were increased were associated with tumors, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. 

* All experiment mentioned tells that there are no replacements for sleep, and sleep deprivation have adverse effects on all system of the body. Matt mentions that regularity is one solution to recovering a healthy sleep cycle where we should be consistent with our sleeping time. The second solution is to keep the body cool as sleep needs the body to drop the temperature by one or two Fahrenheit and maintain it. So, we keep the room temperature around 18 degrees celsius to get quality sleep. And the final piece of advice given in this video is that sleep is not an option but a necessity and acts as a natural life-supporting system. 

* With the increase of current progress and complexity in every field, our sleep cycle is getting affected and therefore it must be made sure that we can get the time to sleep enough in our busy lives. 


### Q .5 What are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better?
* Avoid using mobile or any electronic device during sleep hours duration.
* Only work during working hours and do not allow any condition to affect the sleep quality. 
* Maintain consistency of going and rising from bed.
* Use some exercises to overcome the heavy usage of the electronic device screen, so that I could sleep properly. 
* Take a bath to cool your body temperature and sleep well.

### Q .6 Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points.

* Doing some physical movement has an immediate impact on our stress and depression levels, refreshed our mind, and has a long-lasting effect on our brain. Our brain is a very complex system to understand, but we should know some important facts about it so that we can take appropriate steps for its good functioning. 

* Our brain's first key area is the Prefrontal cortex located behind the forehead and is used to make quick decisions, give proper focus and attention, and decide our personality. The second key area is the Temporal Lobe which is divided into the left and right lobes, and inside the lobe, in our crucial area, Hippocampus is located. It is essential to preserve and retrieve long-term memories. 

* In the journey, to understand how the network of neurons allows us to retain the long terms memories of special events, Wendy switched her study focus to something that had significant brains changing effects which is exercise. In the duration when she decided to recover her physical health by joining sports, gym, and many classes on physical movements, she noticed an increase in her focus, and a boost in her mood while studying and doing research. So, she started studying the effects of exercise on the brain which made her change her complete focus to research on exercise and concluded that exercise is the most transformative thing that we can do to increase neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline immediately. This increase in levels of essentials brains chemicals has a long-lasting effect on our brains and we can work in a fresh mood for a long time with just a single workout. 

* The exercise effects occur immediately when the proper exercise regime is followed which includes increasing cardiorespiratory functions, and this allows us to retain the freshness of the brain working for a longer period. This works because exercise changes the brain's anatomy, physiology, and function. 

* Hippocampus is provided with more newly brain generated cells that increase long-term memory. Exercise also enhances the prefrontal cortex ability so we can focus for a longer time. And finally, exercise gives us a long-lasting good mood condition due to an increase in good mood neurotransmitters.

* Along with functions, exercise also increases the brain's protective ability, because the more we work out, the stronger the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex become. This prevents our brain from the risk of neurodegenerative disease and also reduces the cognitive decline in aging duration. 

* Exercising does not stop the diseases like Alzheimer's but immunes our hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to make the effect of the disease activity after a long time. The minimum effort to get these effects is to do three to four times exercise in a week for 30 minutes and can add some aerobics exercises to get the heart up.

* The exercise to get these effects is not limited only to the gyms and classes, but can also be done by taking a walk around a block or by climbing higher stairs. So, after this video, we should act on the thought that along with being important to increase brain functionality, exercise is also important to protect our brain from the effect of diseases.

### Q .7 What are some steps you can take to exercise more?
* Just increase events of small exercise routine during work when I get tired.
* Do a little warmup exercise every morning after waking up.
* Prefer walking to go to a nearby location.
* Go for a walk after lunch and dinner.
* Learn quick exercises that can be done in a short time and anywhere without equipment to overcome stress and tired muscles.
* Set weekly or daily goals to increase or reduce calories through exercise.
