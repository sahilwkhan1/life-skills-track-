# Grit and Growth Mindset

# 1. Grit

### Q.1. Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines.

The video starts with the story of how Angela Duckworth left a demanding job at 27 years in management consulting to teach seventh-grade students maths in new york city public schools. During that journey, she did the usual activities of conducting quizzes and tests, assigning homework and assignment, and grading the student's tests. 

During this duration, it came to her attention that Intelligence Quotient (IQ) was not the factor that differentiated high-performing students from the rest. Many highest performing students did not have the IQ to required to be called Smartest, whereas students who were actually smart did not perform well. Angela with such experiences was convinced that any subject and topic can be learned by students if they worked hard and gave enough time.

 After serving for years as a teacher, angela left her job and began journaling to become a psychologist. The reason that inspired her for this step, was that she believed that aside from the learning ability or IQ of students, there are other things or ways that can someone in the learning process. She started studying kids and adults in a research team, not only in study-related and technical working areas but also related to the job like military training, National bee, sales companies, and teachers working in tough environments. They predicted which individuals will perform best in their task or succeed and which candidates will find difficulty or face failure. By the end of studying different examples, she found that factors like IQ, health, looks, and factors that are usually considered to be important for getting success in a field are not important but it was something else, which was called grit. 

 A git in simple words is an attitude or a passion for giving continuous efforts, not for some short or a fixed amount of time like hours or months, but a motivation to keep struggling for years, until the goals are achieved. Angela started studying grit in Chicago public schools and provided questionnaires to students and then waited a year to see which students would graduate. Just like previous testing outcomes, here also the result was showing that grittier students have a higher chance of getting succeeded, irrespective of any other characteristics like family income, scores, and what they taught about their safety. 

 At any place, whether in schools or the workplace, the grit that is a passion to keep going on, was found to be grit mattered significantly. Even being that characteristic of such importance, science and studies related to grit available are less. 

 Grit has hardly any relation to any talent, and in some cases is inversely related to any measures of talent. So to facilitate the building of grit, Angela suggested the best solution as a 'growth mindset'. This idea is developed at Sanford university by Dr. Carol Dweck, which means that having a belief that our learning ability is not constant and we can increase it with our efforts. Dr. Cweck proposed that when a student study and get knowledge regarding how the brain works and its functioning and response when they come across some challenges, they have an increased chance of continuing their efforts even after failing. This is because they realized that failing is not a permanent condition and they can change it with their efforts. 

 In this way, having a growth mindset is the best option for building our grit. Along with this, Angela suggests that there is more solution to building grit which is to consider our best idea and also those suitable thoughts that do not have strong reasoning and then try them out. We need to check if we are successful in the implementation of that ideas, and should be ready to be failed so that we can again start our efforts and keep going to get successful in the end. 


### Q .2. What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on?
The first key point from the given video is that we should never consider the usual factors like physique, access to a resource or facility, looks, IQ, and any other ability to be a hindrance in our way to success in any field.

The next point that is worth implementing is that we should learn this term or skill known as grit. Grit has defined as the condition where individuals which giving their best focus and efforts to their goals until they become successful. 

Grit can also said as perseverance and dedication to achieve something. This thinking of not considering failure as a stopping point can allow anyone to succeed in anything.

At last, since we want ourselves to get grittier of working out through any situation, we need to know and implement something called a growth mindset. This is a solution to build our or others' grit and it means studying our brain functioning and response when we get stuck or face failure. So, having a growth mindset makes us believe that a failure stage is not permanent and we can overcome it by putting in more effort.

## 2. Introduction to Growth Mindset

### Q .3. Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines in your own words.
"Growth Mindset" is a term that has become popular today in many areas of studying and working sectors. It was proposed by Stanford professor Carol Dweck who studied the reasons why some people with equal capabilities get success when others don't. In this study, she found that people's mindset that plays important role in this differentiation.

This entire study gives out two major categories of an individual based on mindset, one is a Fixed Mindset and another is a Growth mindset. The fixed mindset person thinks that any successful person is naturally skilled in that area and this is the result of his default skills and abilities, whereas a growth mindset person thinks that a person is successful due to his/her efforts and dedication. 

The reason why a fixed mindset fails as compared to a growth mindset as per the study is due to two thought features which are belief and focus which works on four points. The first point is giving effort, and here a fixed mindset person thinks that he is not good enough and has lack skills, whereas a growth mindset person thinks of building skills and giving his best efforts. So here fixed mindset person believes that he is not skilled in solving a challenge and therefore focuses on avoiding skill building. A growth mindset person believes he can learn more and hence focus on improving his skills and effort very often. 

The second point is facing a challenge, where a fixed mindset person believes that he is in danger and thinks that failure can affect him negatively, so he focuses on avoiding challenges. At this point, a growth mindset person finds an opportunity to upgrade himself as a more skilled and experienced person after facing those challenges and this also builds his problem-solving attitude.

The third point is making mistakes while learning or doing a task, where a fixed mindset person's beliefs, develop fear and hate to make a mistake that makes him avoid even an attempt to solve a difficult task and comprises his learning. In this situation, growth mindset person beliefs that it is appropriate to use the mistake to learn and find a solution that increases his experience and knowledge. In this way, he will avoid similar mistakes in the future and that will make him skilled in this learning or profession. 

The final point is regarding feedback received from others, which leads to a fixed mindset person's beliefs he is getting discouraged by others' opinions, so he focuses on not looking bad in front of others, thereby creating a hindrance to his learning and sometimes even abanded his goals. In this situation, a growth mindset person believes that it is very useful things to use other suggestions in order to improve on our shortcomings and therefore focuses on improvement as per the feedback given. This allows him to move further in his journey to excellence, by improving on his negative points.

So, to use this study's output in our life, we can measure our condition on the spectrum between fixed mindset thinking and growth mindset thinking, so we can act and improve accordingly.

### Q .4 What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on?

The most important point from the video that everyone should implement quickly is that change their mindset towards giving efforts, facing challenges, making mistakes, and improving on feedback. Our mindset should be similar to a person with a growth mindset, so we increase the qualities of outputs we get in our learning, profession, or even personal life.

The second point is that we should measure our current mindset frequently in a spectrum between fixed and growth person mindset. This helps us to think about the solution we can implement to move towards a growth mindset and move towards success.

The third point is to evaluate the cause of our current mindset. If we think, we need to improve our mindset think of whether it is due to our beliefs or our mindset.


## 3.Understanding Internal Locus of Control

### Q .5. What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
From the example of a study conducted by a professor at Columbia University, the concept of Local control was introduced in starting of the video. The study had an example of kids who were given some puzzles and after that some were they performed well because they are smart and some were told that they performed well because they worked hard. So, after that students were told that they were smart, and performed badly at another task, and students with feedback of hard work performed the task well with dedication.

So, the term locus of control means the extent of control of our life, we had over ourselves. Here in the above example, students with smart comment feedback are said to have an external locus of control, the reason is that their motivational source was external and therefore when external conditions do not favor them, the person with an external locus of control loses with motivation and dedication to perform better. 

In the study, the students which were given hard work feedback and then performed well next time, are then said to have an internal locus of control, since their dependencies of motivation and dedication are not with the external situation and they know that only their own efforts and thinking can improve their work outputs.  Unlike external locus of control, people with internal locus know that only their efforts are deciding factors for their output and their current or future condition, so they work hard through any problem, irrespective of any external conditions.

So the video's key point is to make us believe that we should always try to have an internal locus of motivation, to stay motivated at any time and in any conditions.

### Q .6. Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines in your own words.

The video suggests us the following ways to develop a growth mindset :

1. First important solution is to always believe in your ability to solve any problem. Even when we don't have any idea for solving a problem or moving forward, we should always have trust that we will make our way out.

2. Aside from confidence in our abilities, we should never stop questioning ourselves regarding every possible way to improve, so as to assure that we don't stop learning or stop our progress in the illusion that we have enough. We should question ourselves at any stage and success because there is always the possibility to improve and even begin a new journey.

3. another important step is to plan out our own curriculum to grow in a particular direction. At this point, we have to plan out all things we will need to do, how it needs to be done, when it needs to be completed, etc. In short, we need to figure out the best possible way to plan ourselves to always keep moving in our growth journey, and ensure that we do not fall any lack to the routine at any stage of the growth journey.

### Q .8. What are one or more points that you want to take action on from the manual? (Maximum 3)

From the given options, I consider taking action on the following points,
* I will need to always hold responsibility for my learning since from the locus of learning section, it can be concluded that our current condition is the result are own efforts. So I need to always have an Internal locus of control, that is self-motivated to continue my learning journey, irrespective of external conditions. 
* Next point I will act on is that I will always stay relaxed and focused under any conditions. This is because to keep our learning journey, we need a relaxed mind to solve the problem.
* The final point I will act on is that I will treat new concepts and situations as learning opportunities and will never get pressurized by any concept or situation. Not getting heavily discouraged is crucial to solving any problem with a calm mind. If we get tense in a situation, that will result in improper results. Therefore, I will always take new challenges as an opportunity to learn.
