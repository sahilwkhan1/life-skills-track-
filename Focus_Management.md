# Focus Management



## Q .1 What is Deep Work?
The term 'Deep Work' is introduced by Cal Newport, which means focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. The reason why Cal Newport used this name is that we all did cognitive activities a lot throughout our lives like playing games like chess or snakes and ladders, solving puzzles, etc that are different from other types of efforts, and never used a separate word for it. This type of effort has a great benefit we are unaware of. 

Cal defines Working deeply on something as a hard focus while performing a task. When Cal was in a theory group at MIT, he was in contact with professional theoreticians having high thinking capabilities along with honors like the Turing awards which is often referred to as the "Noble Prize of Computing". There Cal observed that their best skill was the focus. The professional would talk about how they can focus intensely on their work.   

Coding is also one example of deep work, in which we need to deeply use our cognitive abilities and focus intensely to use all tools together to make a solution. Also, the skill of focusing without getting distracted is something very essential for deep work, and we need to study and be able to get benefits out of it.


## Q .2 Paraphrase all the ideas in the above videos and this one in detail.

 As per Cal Newport, deep work is the complete focus while performing professional activities without allowing any distraction, such as our cognitive abilities being pushed to work at their best. 

 The personalities like JK Rowling also used this method to finish the Jungle Book and Bill gates wrote the basic software for Microsoft in just 8 weeks, which later became the foundation of the Microsoft company. The author also claims that this method allowed him to double his research paper output while performing family duties and jobs simultaneously. 

 The neuroscience behind working deep work is that when we focus intensely, myelin develops our brain tissues to fire faster and cleaner. So this process allows us to get new and upgrades solutions comfortably.

 This deep work ability is precious as it can help us to stand out among others. The study shows that we are only able to focus on our tasks in this world of distractions by only a rate of 50%. So, we can gain an advantage to excel among others by working on our skill of deep working.
