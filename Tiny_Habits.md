# Tiny Habits


## Q.1 Your takeaways from the video.

* People often fail to maintain a life lasting changes in their life, because they expect very much in very less time. Instead, of trying to make a big change quickly, we should start with tiny habits to reach our goals.

* Tiny habits can be the little behavior or activities which we can get accustomed to doing daily or regularly, take very less time to complete, and are easy to do.

* These tiny habits stack up slowly to make a big change in our life.

* First key element to start building tiny habits is to do our required behavior just after a behavior we already do regularly. For example, if we want to increase our current affairs knowledge, we can read a news post right after we perform our social media surfing.

* Second step to do is, to keep the small task as easy as possible so that we never get frustrated performing it, or bored with it.

* Third and most important element is giving any rewards, appraisal, or appreciation after performing the task. This is because we know our brain's dopamine enables us to do tasks in expectation of some pleasurable or happy feeling. Since we are coupling the task with a good feeling, we will want to do it again, and with more passion.

* We should start with the small good habits, and then try to keep them consistent to build momentum, in order to make a big change that leads us to a happier and healthier life.


## Q.2 Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible

* BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits" presents a different approach to creating lasting behavior change compared to traditional methods that focus on making big changes and setting significant goals. 

* The video highlights that starting with tiny habits that are easy to do and can be integrated into our daily routine is crucial to forming new habits.

* According to Fogg, emotions play a crucial role in the formation of new habits. Habits are created when we repeat behaviors that make us feel good. To develop new habits, it is important to associate positive emotions with the small actions we want to take and to acknowledge and celebrate our progress as we move towards our desired outcomes.

* Repetition in establishing new habits is very important. By consistently practicing small habits multiple times throughout the day and connecting them to existing routines or habits, individuals can create a favorable cycle that strengthens the desired behavior.

* Fogg also stresses the importance of being specific when identifying tiny habits. He suggests breaking down larger goals into small, actionable steps that are easy to accomplish. By doing so, we can create a clear path forward and increase our chances of success.

* The main idea conveyed in "Tiny Habits" is that making small and manageable changes is crucial for developing long-lasting behavioral transformations. By commencing with tiny habits, linking them to positive emotions, setting specific goals, and practicing them regularly, individuals can gradually build new habits that result in significant changes in their lives.

## Q.5 Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

* We should always keep our efforts to improve ourselves whether personally or personally, if not more than at least by 1 percent.


*  Small improvements will build later into significant changes in our life, that can help us achieve success.

* Instead of making a step toward a big change, we should focus on being more consistent and maintaining steady progress. This way we can create life-long habits.

* Another step is to remain updated with our progress of habits, in order to make sure we are moving in the correct path. We can use a tracking app or records in some books, to track the small improvements daily.

* We should be patient with our goals and our regular steps' output. We should believe that our small steps will definitely pay off success at some point in time.
  

## Q.6 Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes, and outcomes.

* From the book's perspective by considering the identity factor, our success rate is deeply affected by our identity. The more our identity is suitable with the habits we want to form, the greater the chances to get success in building that habit for a long-lasting period.

* Apart from good habits, bad habits are also an outcome of our identity. For example, if we have an identity of giving up quickly while facing difficulty, the bad habits of failing and running away from goals increases. So, the book suggests that we should adopt a new identity, which matches the habits we want to build. If we want to build the habits of exercise, we should build our identity of staying physically fit and giving importance to exercise. In this way, it becomes easier to build certain habits.

* Regarding the book's perspective on processes, the focus on the process of building habits is more important as compared to the focus on end goals. This is because, when we focus more on getting success than the process of reaching it, we get distracted from our path, and also get demotivated by failure and difficulties. Therefore it is important that we give importance to doing small regular tasks rather than big chunks of activity, and enjoy our process of building habits to make long-lasting changes in our behavior.
  
* At last, the outcomes are the result of our identity and processes, which we have used to build those habits. From the book, we can conclude that by focusing on the process of habit formation and aligning our habits with our goals, we can get outcomes that are regular and similar to the expectation, that we had before starting to build habits.



## Q.7 Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

  * First, we can reduce the difficulties in the path of good habits practice, and increase difficulties for our bad habits.
  * Next thing is setting up an environment, that is favorable to trigger us to perform our set tiny habits daily. This can be done, by reducing the distance of tablets that we want to consume daily or by listening and always reminding ourselves of final outcomes, so that we can get motivated to return to our habits.
  * Another task is to split our final goals into very tiny habits, that we can do it very easily and consistently. 
  * Along with making our task easier, we can also set such rewards or appreciation that will make us crave to return to tiny habits daily, and do it passionately.

## Q.8 Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult.
* To start making a bad habit difficult, we can first attach it to our good habit. For example, when we crave to waste our time on social media apps, we fix that we will do it only after studying or learning course material. This way, our attention to bad habits will be diverted.
* Next solution is to increase friction, which means making it difficult to practice our bad habits. For example, if we are addicted to wasting time on online applications on our phone, we can use uninstall the mobile application, but use the application only through the browser. This way we will block our instant access to rewards we get through bad habits.
* To decrease practicing bad habits, we can remove the cues or triggering things of bad habits from our surroundings. This way it increases the chance of forgetting our bad habits.

## Q.9 Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

  1. Divide the reading materials into many small parts or topics, that I can easily read and feel comfortable after reading.
  2. I would set a reminder alarm on my mobile to make the cue for reading habits more visible.
  3. Sticking the paper reminding me to read, on a desk or any location I frequently notice, can also make things easier to remember daily habits.
  4. After gaining knowledge of technical things or tools by reading such as coding, I would immediately use it, in my practical things to increase my rewards feeling and craving to get more perfection.
  5. I can reduce the efforts to access resources from where I read, such as creating a quick access icon or making a bookmark of the resource.
  6. Finally, I will talk and share my habits with my colleagues, friends, and family, so I can remember habits during any discussions.


## Q.10 Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
* I would like to eliminate the habit of wasting my time using access mobile. I will use the following technique,
  1. Delete the apps on which excessive time I am wasting. 
  2. If deleting is not the solution, then I would make my access to the app difficult by adding a code lock to it.
  3. I would always remind myself of the adverse effects of excessive mobile usage, on my eyesight.
  4. I would track and write down my hours wasted on mobile applications, which would help to realize me to take preventive measures.
