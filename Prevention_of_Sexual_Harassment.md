# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Q.1 What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
* Sexual harassment is defined as any type of unwelcomed or unwanted sexual behavior which can create a hostile or intimidating work or social environment. This behavior can make someone uncomfortable or unsafe in a sexual way.

   There are three types of sexual harassment:- 
   
   1. Verbal harassment :
   
       Verbal harassment can be classified as commenting about clothing, making sexually offensive or gender-based jokes, commenting on the body, requesting sexual favors, or asking a person out repeatedly. It also includes threatening someone, spreading rumors about a person's personal or sexual life, using foul or abusive language, and a remark that indirectly suggests something sexual or unpleasant.

   2. Visual harassment :
   
      Visual harassment consists of drawing, pictures or posters, screen savers, and sending any electronic messaging displaying sexual images or videos, cartoons, or text of sexual nature.

   3. Physical harassment : 
   
      This type of behavior includes sexual assault, sexual gesturing, gazing unpleasantly, blocking movements, and touching in an inappropriate manner such as rubbing, pinching, stroking, patting, hugging, or kissing. 


* Sexual harassment in general follows under two categories, 
  
  1. 'This for that' :
   
       This category is also called 'Quid Pro Quo' which happens when a person in a superior position uses job benefits, raises, promotions, or punishments as a means to request sexual favors. 
   
   2. Hostile Work Enviroment :
   
      This situation occurs when the acts or behavior of one employee becomes an obstacle in the working of another employee or creates an offensive and threatening environment. This happens when a person passes offensive comments repeatedly which makes another person uncomfortable, and this affects their performance and also forced them to leave opportunities, in fear of any contact with the harassing person.


## Q.2 What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

* In case of facing or witnessing any event of repeated offensive behavior from someone, I would take the following steps :
  
  1. The first thing I would do is assess the situation and find out the effect or the harm it can cause, so if the situation can be dealt with just by talking or conveying the concern regarding the behavior, I would take that option. 
  2. In case the previous options don't have any chance of sorting things, I would immediately report or inform the relevant authority such as the human resources manager, a committee created for such inÄ«cidents, the supervisor, or if required the law enforcement regarding the incident.
  3. While reporting, I would provide many details as possible for the incident occurred along with the time incident occurred, and an image or video if available as proof.
  4. Then, I would take the update from the report authority or person if any investigation or proper action is taken for the reported incident. If the situation is not handled properly by the reported authority or the response is not satisfying, I would escalate the issue to a higher authority.
  5. If the situation has affected me personally, I would inform and take the help of my closest friends and family members.
